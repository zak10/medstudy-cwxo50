# Technical Specifications

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Executive Summary

The Medical Research Platform is a web-based system designed to democratize medical research through community-driven observational studies ("unstudies"). The platform addresses the critical gap between individual health experimentation and formal clinical research by providing structured protocols, data collection tools, and analysis capabilities. Primary stakeholders include study participants, protocol creators, and supplement company partners, with an expected impact of generating valuable real-world health intervention data while reducing barriers to participation in medical research.

### High-Level Description

| Component | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol Management | Standardized templates with safety parameters and data collection requirements |
| Data Collection | Structured capture of blood work, biometrics, and participant experiences |
| Analysis Engine | Signal detection and pattern recognition across participant cohorts |
| Community Features | Moderated forums and direct messaging for participant interaction |

### Success Criteria
