A comprehensive platform for democratizing medical research through community-driven observational studies ("unstudies"). This system bridges the gap between individual health experimentation and formal clinical research by providing structured protocols, data collection tools, and analysis capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Medical Research Platform enables:
- Standardized protocol management for supplement-based studies
- Structured data collection for blood work, biometrics, and experiences
- Advanced analysis engine for signal detection and pattern recognition
- Moderated community features for participant interaction

### Target Metrics
- 50+ active protocols within first year
- 80% protocol completion rate
- 95% data collection compliance
- 1,000 active participants in 6 months
- 5 verified supplement company partnerships

## üèó System Architecture

The platform utilizes a modern, scalable architecture:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3.0+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Backend**: Django 4.2+ with Python 3.11+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Cache**: Redis 7.0+
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ 3.11+
- **Infrastructure**: AWS with Docker 24.0+ and Terraform 1.5+
